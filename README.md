# Cancer-Detection-Kaggle-Mini-Project

Detecting metastatic cancer in digital pathology images is an important task in medical diagnosi. The dataset used here is a modified version of the PatchCamelyon (PCam) dataset, which has been adjusted to remove duplicate images found in the original version.

For this week's mini-project, I'll go through a Kaggle competition: Histopathologic Cancer Detection. This competition is a binary image classification problem where I'll identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans.
